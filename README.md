# Wat (is) up (with my external) doc(umentation)

## What is it?

A vim plugin to indicate that code is referenced in external systems.

1. It hightlights lines that are referenced in external systems.
1. It gives you information on the lines referenced when the cursor is on those lines.
1. It allows you open the referenced system an external browser.

## Installation:

### Plug

```
  Plug 'tgsoverly/watupdoc.vim'
```

### Configuration

To open in an external browser
```
nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>od <Plug>(WatupdocOpen)
```

Here is a demo:

What I am doing:

1. Opening a file that has a link to it in clubhouse.io
2. `:w` the file to trigger the plugin.
3. Moving the cursor over the lines to show the information at the bottom of the screen.
4. `\od` on the line to open that external reference in a browser.



## What problem is being solved?

You have discussions around nice to have features and you say something like "Next time we change this code we should update this method."  Now you have another problem: how do you track that work?  This plugin is an attempt to solve that problem.

All you need to do is store a link to the line of code in a `Supported URL Format` in a `Supported External System`.
